UPDATES:

Added an article from early 2024, sharing some personal practices from the past year: [Health & Wellness Blogger's 2023 Summary](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/675470252).

Given that the article is quite long and many readers may not have the patience to finish it, I also recorded a [video version](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EW4y1R7yi/) that essentially covers most of the content from the article.

Additionally, regarding healthy living practices, I'm providing a minimalist basic list for your reference:

- Maintain sufficient sleep duration and quality.
- Do not smoke.
- Try to exercise daily.
- Reduce sugar intake.

Achieving these four points alone can lead to a decent state of health. The rest can be supplemented and adjusted based on individual health conditions.

# Background

Last May, I wrote an article introducing [Lex Fridman's daily routine](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/371254789). Subsequently, I adopted his methods to standardize and improve my own daily life. The overall implementation over the past year has been very effective, and at the end of this article, I will share some of my practices and the tools I used.

In recent months, I stumbled upon a [Rich Roll podcast interview with Andrew Huberman](https://youtu.be/2ekdc6jCu2E) on YouTube, which introduced neuroscientific principles and "tools" for improving our daily work and learning performance. It instantly opened up a new world. Following that, I binge-watched several more episodes of Huberman's own podcast, learning about various aspects related to our daily life, health, learning, work, exercise, and more. The biggest difference from many other "health preservation" articles and videos is that Huberman is a neuroscience professor at Stanford, and the content he discusses is **derived from high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific research**. Starting from the body's operational principles, he meticulously explains relevant experiments and conclusions, offering many practical suggestions (many of which are zero-cost, not promotions...).

Through this series of learning, I gradually felt as if I was learning about the "composition and operating principles" of the human body. Through a series of tools and practices, we can **"optimize" our human system much like fine-tuning software programs**. This article will introduce some of these relevant knowledge points. Please note that the original podcast contains a great deal of professional discourse, which has largely been removed in this article to explain things in a more narrative, easier-to-understand manner. Of course, accuracy may decrease as a result. If you wish to obtain more professional content, I strongly recommend watching the [original podcast content](https://hubermanlab.com/).

# Sleep

If you want to achieve health, better work and study states, improve physiological health such as immunity and metabolism, and psychological health such as better mood and focus, the most important prerequisite is good sleep.

## Principles

The most crucial control mechanism for sleep is our internal biological clock. Under the influence of the biological clock, various chemical substances in our body change, and body temperature also fluctuates, affecting our various internal states and external behaviors. Professor Huberman vividly describes how this "biological clock" works: in the morning, the body releases cortisol and adrenaline, which wake us up and also set a countdown timer for the pineal gland to release melatonin, making us feel sleepy again over ten hours later.

The biggest factor affecting this biological clock is light exposure. Besides enabling us to see, another major function of our eyes is to **receive light information through melanopsin ganglion cells to set our internal biological clock**. This is why sometimes after an all-nighter, even if we haven't slept for a long time, as the sun rises, the overall biological clock is reset to a wake-up state, and the release of various chemical substances can suddenly make us feel energetic again. Many subsequent best practices are related to this principle; we need to control the timing, type, and duration of light exposure we receive.

Additionally, **body temperature is also a means to control our biological clock**. Generally, our body temperature gradually rises from a lower state during deep sleep to waking up and continues to increase. Towards the end of the day, it begins to gradually decrease until we enter sleep again.

## Practices

Based on the principles above, Professor Huberman provides a series of best practices for improving sleep:

- Cortisol release is linked to sun exposure, so if you want to wake up quickly and maintain good mental clarity during the day, **you should go outside and expose yourself to sunlight for 2-10 minutes after waking up**. This has significant benefits for blood pressure control, psychological state, and setting the sleep "countdown clock." Outdoor natural light is best; for artificial light, blue light is better, and it's best if the light source is from above (like the sky). Based on light intensity calculations, receiving sunlight through a window reduces intensity by over 50%, and achieving the same effect would require 50 to 100 times the exposure time. Interestingly, this also applies to visually impaired individuals, as the melanopsin ganglion cells mentioned earlier are not cells used for visual imaging.
- Correspondingly, **at night, try to minimize light exposure**, as this will disrupt our biological clock, making the body's system mistakenly think it's daytime. Especially between 11 PM and 4 AM, receiving light will inhibit dopamine release for the next few days, affecting mood, mental health, focus, learning ability, metabolism, and more. The role and mechanism of dopamine will be introduced separately later.
- If it's unavoidable to be exposed to light at night, dim red light from a low position, candles, etc., will be relatively better. If you need to use a computer, it's recommended to use blue blocker glasses, which might have a similar effect to some computer software that automatically adjusts screen color temperature.
- Observing the sunset in the evening also helps with subsequent sleep, and can even mitigate the negative effects of light exposure at night, which is somewhat miraculous.
- A person's mental state generally experiences a brief dip in the middle of the day, so a nap might be helpful for some. It can also be replaced by other non-sleep deep rest methods, such as [Yoga Nidra](https://youtu.be/M0u9GST_j3s), [meditation](https://www.headspace.com/), [self-hypnosis](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelSealey) (you can use apps like Reveri), etc.
- Effect of body temperature on the biological clock cycle:
  - Taking a cold shower in the morning rapidly raises body temperature, shifting the sleep cycle earlier (waking up earlier).
  - Exercising at night keeps body temperature high, thus delaying the cycle (sleeping later).
  - You can purchase smart mattresses with automatic temperature control to improve sleep quality.
- Generally recommended exercise times: 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking up. However, the overall impact seems relatively small.
- Dietary and medicinal factors:
  - Caffeine occupies adenosine receptors, blocking sleep signals. Many articles suggest avoiding coffee after noon, but Huberman states there's no scientific evidence that caffeine affects everyone the same way; you need to test it yourself. For example, he can drink coffee at 5 PM and still fall asleep normally.
  - Magnesium helps with sleep.
  - Apigenin can also aid sleep, but be mindful of its effects on estrogen.
  - It's advised not to consume too much taurine.
  - It's not recommended to use melatonin for sleep, as melatonin supplements themselves have inconsistent specifications, and melatonin can easily induce depressive moods.
  - At noon, you can eat low-calorie and tyrosine-rich foods, such as nuts, soy, and some vegetables, to boost dopamine and adrenaline, helping you stay awake.
  - In the evening, you can eat starches, white meat, and other tryptophan-rich foods, which convert to serotonin, making you calmer and more likely to fall asleep.
- For most people, 6-8 hours of sleep is considered healthy.

# Diet

In Lex's previous sharing, he mentioned adopting ketogenic diet and fasting habits, which drew my attention to eating habits. Professor Huberman also conveniently has several podcasts discussing fasting, gut health, and other interesting topics.

## Fasting Background

We can divide the body's chemical states related to eating into two categories:

1. **Fed state:** When blood sugar levels are high. At this time, our body is more actively engaged in cell replication and growth.
2. **Fasted state:** When blood sugar levels are low. At this time, our body is more actively engaged in internal cell repair and clearing (autophagic).

Since we naturally don't eat during sleep, a portion of our sleep time generally puts us in a fasted state. The choice of eating times essentially controls the duration and balance of these two states. Interestingly, many ethnic cultures and religions around the world have customs related to fasting, some lasting for many days.

In 2012, scientists began experiments on mice, dividing them into two large groups: one group could eat at any time of the day, while the other could only eat within a fixed 8-hour window. Within these large groups, subgroups were further distinguished, giving mice healthy and unhealthy foods. The results showed that mice who could only eat within the 8-hour window, even if they ate unhealthy high-fat foods, still maintained or even improved their health levels, showing significant improvements compared to all groups without restrictions.

This research shook the academic community. Subsequently, many more experiments and papers were published on humans, different genders, ages, and professions (including athletes). Scientists found that this **intermittent fasting state offers numerous benefits for the body**, including: promoting liver health, bile acid metabolism, self-healing of inflammation, weight management, increasing brown fat reserves (beneficial for health), preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver, blood sugar control, gut health, and so on. If intermittent fasting becomes a habit for more than 60 days, our body will also tend to metabolize fat for energy, aiding in weight control.

Therefore, Professor Huberman points out that **when we eat is as important as what we eat**. This research has also led many academic researchers, including Huberman himself, to adopt fasting habits.

## Fasting Practice

Since prolonged fasting is quite difficult, most research focuses on intermittent fasting. Simply put, it's like the mouse experiment mentioned earlier: eating only within a fixed time window during the day (aligned with the sleep cycle) and consuming no food during other periods. Here's a simple summary of basic and advanced versions:

- **Basic:** If you want to enjoy the fundamental benefits of fasting, the simplest principle is to **not eat for at least 1 hour after waking up, and also not eat anything 2-3 hours before going to bed.**
- **Advanced:** Current research suggests that the **ideal eating window is 8 hours**. Combined with social customs, generally reasonable times are between 10 AM-6 PM or 12 PM-8 PM. It seems **skipping breakfast isn't a bad thing** :)
- The author specifically reminds that if you want to build muscle through fitness, it's recommended to shift this time window earlier, as protein intake in the morning is beneficial for muscle growth. Exercise time can be chosen freely.
- Maintaining **stability in this eating window** is also very important. Otherwise, it's like frequently experiencing jet lag, which significantly reduces the benefits.
- If you want to try advanced fasting, it's suggested to gradually shift your eating habits, for example, by shortening your eating window by 1 hour every two days until you reach the ideal 8 hours.

It's worth noting that "not eating anything" here doesn't mean you can't even drink water. From the background above, whether you are in a fasted state primarily depends on blood sugar levels, therefore:

- Drinking water, tea, coffee (without milk), etc., does not break the fast. However, consuming even a spoonful of sugar will break it.
- To enter a fasted state quickly after dinner, you can do some light exercise, such as walking, to speed up blood sugar clearance.
- Metformin, berberine, etc., can directly promote blood sugar clearance. Cinnamon bark and lemon juice can also slightly lower blood sugar.

Finally, if you feel dizzy or shaky during fasting, you don't need to eat immediately or consume sugar. You can drink a little salt water (with lemon juice, if desired), which usually relieves the symptoms well. This reminds me that Lex mentioned taking pills to supplement various electrolyte elements, such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

## Diet and Digestive Health

Since my personal gastrointestinal function is relatively poor, I paid special attention to the topic of digestive health. Huberman invited a very renowned microbiologist, Sonnenburg, to introduce the relationship between gut microbiome and our health, from whom I learned many new things:

- The gut microbiome not only affects the healthy functioning of the digestive system but also plays a **crucial role in the human immune system**.
- The way infants are born and grow shapes very different gut bacterial ecosystems. Exposure to microbial environments (but with caution for disease-causing situations) is beneficial for maintaining a healthy microbiome, such as having pets at home or letting children play freely, without excessive cleaning and disinfection.
- What constitutes a healthy gut bacterial ecosystem currently has no standard conclusion. However, generally speaking, **a high degree of microbial diversity usually indicates better health**.
- Antibiotics severely disrupt the gut microbiome and should be used cautiously.

In the interview, they specifically discussed an experiment on what kind of dietary approach best maintains the diversity and health of our gut microbiome. The experiment mainly compared two additional diets:

- **High-fiber foods:** Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts. These are traditionally considered very healthy foods, and the breakdown of many fibers requires the help of gut bacteria; in other words, fiber is their "food."
- **Fermented foods:** Yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, etc. Note that these need to be naturally fermented, generally refrigerated and non-canned foods. And for foods like yogurt, it's crucial to avoid added sugar or other additives.

The experimental results were quite surprising:

- The group consuming fermented foods significantly increased their gut microbial diversity. Participants showed a **significant reduction in dozens of immune markers, leading to better suppression of various inflammations**. Surprisingly, the gut microbiome can even regulate inflammation.
- For people whose gut microbiome was already highly diverse, consuming high-fiber foods was helpful. If not, high-fiber foods were not very helpful. In the process of industrialization, human eating habits have shifted over many generations to consuming large amounts of meat and processed foods, and the gut microbiome's ecosystem cannot be changed solely by increasing the amount of fiber-rich foods.

Additionally, in the interview, they discussed specific dietary recommendations, citing [Christopher Gardner's research comparing ketogenic and Mediterranean diets](https://youtu.be/sJLK3sVexIk). Here's a summary of practical advice:

- **To improve gut microbiome diversity, the best way is to consume natural fermented foods twice a day.**
- High-fiber foods are beneficial for maintaining gut microbiome health. It's recommended that daily diets be primarily plant-based, minimizing the intake of highly processed foods, and controlling sugar intake. Professor Sonnenburg also shared a story that at conferences attended by microbiologists, the salad bar is always in high demand :) Rich Roll, mentioned earlier, is also a vegetarian.
- **The effectiveness of probiotics is not widely supported by research**, and the regulation of such products is very limited. **The effectiveness of prebiotics is also mixed**, with issues like lack of diversity and too rapid dissolution raising doubts about overall efficacy.
- The Mediterranean diet has similar health benefits to the ketogenic diet but is easier to adhere to. Furthermore, long-term practice of the ketogenic diet may pose some risks. Therefore, the **Mediterranean diet structure is generally more recommended**.

It's also worth noting that we have the official [Chinese Dietary Guidelines](https://sspai.com/post/72984), which might be more suitable for Eastern eating habits.

# Mindset & Motivation

This section primarily introduces the principles of the human dopamine system and how to leverage it to foster healthy, disciplined lifestyles. This episode is one of Huberman's most-viewed since he started, offering excellent guidance for strengthening our minds.

## Principles

Dopamine is a very important chemical substance, mainly acting on two neural circuits: one affects body movement (e.g., Parkinson's disease is related to insufficient dopamine secretion); the other affects our motivation, desire, and pleasure, which is related to almost all activities we engage in, whether work, study, social, or leisure. Here, we will primarily discuss dopamine's latter influence. Why we "give up" is actually due to continuously rising norepinephrine levels under anxiety, stress, and frustration. When these levels exceed a certain threshold, cognitive control in the nervous system shuts down, and we give up. Dopamine can inhibit the action of norepinephrine, thereby continuously "motivating" us forward.

The level of dopamine in the nervous system affects our emotions. When dopamine levels are low, we feel depressed and unmotivated, while high dopamine levels make us feel excited and happy. Normally, our body is at a dopamine baseline state. When we achieve exciting goals (e.g., winning a game, getting a high score on a test), dopamine levels reach a peak, at which point we experience immense pleasure. After the peak, dopamine levels drop back to a level lower than the baseline, and this state persists for some time.

There are two very important principles here:

- The absolute level of dopamine is only one aspect; **what's more important is the magnitude of its "relative change."** For example, when you see an interesting video on Douyin (TikTok), your dopamine level rises, and you feel happy. When you scroll to the next video, the pleasure you feel might not be as intense, because dopamine is already at a relatively high level, making it difficult to create a larger change. The same video, if you saw it a few days later, might seem more interesting. So, **when you continuously do something you enjoy, your threshold for feeling pleasure will constantly increase.**
- **The total "reserve" of dopamine is limited!** This means that whether you gain pleasure through learning, work, entertainment, social activities, exercise, or other means, the "currency of happiness" consumed is the same: dopamine. Let's look at a few examples of the impact of this principle:
  - Many disciplined people say they live a "work hard, play hard" lifestyle. For instance, they achieve satisfaction and accomplishment through high-intensity work on weekdays, and find pleasure through various leisure, exercise, and social activities on weekends. In essence, this is all about releasing dopamine to gain happiness. Over a long period, our body's dopamine baseline will gradually decrease, leading to a feeling of "burnout" and an inability to maintain previous interest and energy in many things.
  - Many people become addicted to video games because they provide huge dopamine release stimuli that make them feel happy. But it's important to realize that dopamine reserves are limited. If you become addicted, your dopamine depletion problem will become very severe: on one hand, fewer things will interest you, perhaps only playing games can bring happiness; on the other hand, eventually, even playing games itself may fail to trigger dopamine release, leading to severe depression.

Furthermore, **dopamine also has a superimposed effect**. For example, if you like working out, exercise will stimulate dopamine release. When we actually go to the gym, we might unconsciously arrange many other "pleasure factors," such as choosing a day when we're in good spirits, drinking energy drinks before exercising, going with friends, socializing while working out, listening to favorite music or podcasts, and so on. These factors also promote dopamine release, making you feel "unprecedented joy." But remember the previous principle: the higher the dopamine peak, the longer the subsequent sustained low, and in the long run, this may reduce your ability to derive pleasure simply from exercise. There are many such examples, like eating with friends while playing on your phone and posting photos on social media – calculate how many pleasure factors are superimposed :)

## External Factors Affecting Dopamine

Let's look at the various factors that specifically influence dopamine release. First, those that promote dopamine secretion:

- Chocolate, raises dopamine to 1.5 times baseline
- Sexual activity, raises to 2 times
- Nicotine, raises to 2.5 times
- Cocaine, raises to 2.5 times
- Amphetamines, raises to 10 times
- Caffeine itself only slightly increases dopamine, but it inhibits some dopamine receptors, amplifying the perceived effect of the same amount of dopamine.
- Yerba Mate, contains caffeine, can control blood sugar, and also protects dopamine neurons.
- Tribulus Terrestris can also increase dopamine (essentially equivalent to L-DOPA) and improve male sperm count and quality.
- Exercise, with a subjective component; for people who enjoy running, it can increase to 2 times baseline.
- Healthy social relationships also promote dopamine release.

Regarding food, Professor Huberman **highly recommends Yerba Mate**.

There are also many drugs that increase dopamine release or affect its efficacy:

- L-Tyrosine, increases dopamine.
- Phenethylamine (PEA), also found in chocolate, can increase dopamine.
- Huperzine A, increases dopamine.
- Various "smart drugs" like Adderall, Modafinil, Alpha-GPC, Ginkgo, etc. Many students abroad probably know about these.

Generally, **continuous use of these drugs is not recommended** because the high peak of dopamine release will lead to a decrease in baseline levels, resulting in an inability to enjoy activities, difficulty focusing, limited learning ability, and neuronal plasticity. Huberman states that **using them once a week should be safe.**

Finally, there's a rather special study: **cold water immersion can increase dopamine release to about 2.5 times baseline**, and the effect lasts longer, up to about 3 hours. It's recommended to use water temperatures of 10-14 degrees Celsius, and be careful. Also, cold showers don't need to be too frequent; about 11 minutes per week is sufficient. If you are already accustomed to cold showers, then they will no longer have the effect of releasing dopamine.

Some factors also decrease dopamine, such as:

- **Melatonin, which can cause a reduction in dopamine**. As mentioned earlier, it's not recommended to use melatonin to aid sleep or adjust to jet lag.
- Exposure to light during sleep will also cause dopamine levels to drop for the next few days. **Using your phone when you can't sleep in the middle of the night is very harmful.**

## Maintaining Healthy Dopamine Levels

Having understood the principles and various influencing factors, let's explore how to effectively design our lifestyle and work habits to maintain healthy, sustainable dopamine levels.

To recap, we've learned that dopamine reserves are limited, and addiction to one thing continuously raises the pleasure threshold. So, how can we maintain long-term interest and engagement in an activity without depleting dopamine? A classic example is how casinos operate: we don't win every bet, but occasionally winning releases dopamine, fluctuating based on the amount won, which entices players to keep participating. This is a very effective **intermittent and random reward mechanism**. It feels like many games and social media products also adopt this idea in their design.

For activities we frequently engage in, we can simulate this mechanism. Remember the **dopamine superposition effect** mentioned earlier? We can **achieve variations in dopamine release by randomizing the number of superimposed factors**. Taking fitness as an example, we can randomly decide whether to listen to music today, whether to bring our phone to the gym, whether to drink an energy drink before working out, and so on. If we do nothing else and simply exercise, the dopamine release will be relatively lower. This way, we can simulate a random reward mechanism where dopamine release is sometimes high and sometimes low.

## Growth Mindset

Finally, let's look at how to build a good mindset to leverage the dopamine system for self-improvement.

There's a well-known experiment where a group of children who naturally loved drawing were given rewards after completing their artwork. Later, after these rewards were removed, the children's interest and motivation for drawing significantly decreased. This experiment shows that when we receive a reward (like money, food, etc.) for an activity, we **actually reduce the inherent pleasure of the activity itself**. Moreover, dopamine itself influences our perception of time and our emotional state. If we **always target the reward after completing an activity, very little dopamine is released throughout the process, making an already difficult process even harder to sustain**.

Thinking about it carefully, this is a very interesting observation. Dopamine is somewhat like our "instinctive system," determining whether we have the motivation to do something. But conversely, **our subjective thoughts can influence how this system works**. This is why humans can break free from animal instincts and achieve many feats that require "anti-human" effort. The experiment above is an example of a negative effect caused by our subjective thoughts; we can naturally achieve a positive effect, which is the growth mindset.

Specifically, it means **through self-suggestion, treating the effortful process itself as a "reward."** The idea that "I'm working hard, this process itself is interesting, and it will make me continuously stronger" will stimulate the body's system to release dopamine during the process. This dopamine elevates our mood and motivation levels, making difficulties encountered during the effort easier to overcome. Focus on the process itself, rather than external stimuli before the process (like the drugs mentioned earlier) or huge rewards after the process.

This mindset seems very subjective, but this is how our nervous system works. While human "hardware systems" are quite similar, the "software" running on top, like knowledge and mindset, can be vastly different. **We can change our preferences for various activities through self-discipline and self-suggestion.** For example, by suggesting the health benefits of fasting, we can gain satisfaction, rather than relying on a huge meal after fasting. By disciplining ourselves against the allure of high-fat, high-salt foods, and self-suggesting the benefits of plant-based foods, after a period, we might even find broccoli quite delicious. This is why we introduced many foundational principles in this article, not just behavioral advice, because this theoretical knowledge empowers us to engage in better self-suggestion :)

The dopamine system also has mechanisms that create "obstacles" to our cognitive growth. For instance, when information supports our pre-existing beliefs, it can also trigger dopamine release, making us feel happy. This fundamentally alters our perception of the world. Thus, it's evident how rare a "beginner's mind" is, and a large part of the reason for so many unresolved debates online can be attributed to this. How can we overcome these neurological flaws? One possible method is to regulate emotions as much as possible to achieve a calm state (increasing serotonin levels), which allows us to better listen to and absorb information that conflicts with our own cognition, and to collaborate more effectively.

This particular podcast episode had a profound impact on me. I highly recommend watching this one: [Mindset & Drive](https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction/). I believe you'll gain different insights.

# Learning & Focus

Building on our understanding of dopamine's mechanisms, we can further explore topics related to brain health, focus, and efficient learning.

## Principles of Learning

From a neuroscientific perspective, the essence of learning is neural rewiring. More specifically, it requires the brain to be in a chemical state conducive to learning, often referred to by Huberman as neuroplasticity. To achieve this neuroplastic state, two important conditions are needed: sufficient focus and a "mistake" signal (more on this later). Another interesting mechanism of the brain is that during learning in a neuroplastic state, acetylcholine marks the neurons that need to change, while the actual neural rewiring primarily occurs during rest and sleep. Doesn't that sound a bit like a JVM's garbage collection mechanism? :)

What is a "mistake" signal? When we try to do something but don't achieve the expected outcome, the body sends signals to the brain: "I made a mistake." Being in this cognitive state of error and frustration, the nervous system releases chemical substances like adrenaline (increasing alertness), acetylcholine (enhancing focus), and dopamine (promoting neuronal change and rewiring), activating neuronal plasticity. This means that **making mistakes is an important prerequisite for entering a learning state**. Machine learning students should be very familiar with this; it's exactly like training a model! :) Additionally, many people might think that a "flow state" is the optimal state for learning, but Huberman disagrees. **Flow is a state of high concentration and near-automation, which occurs when we are doing things we already know how to do, not when we are learning new knowledge or skills.**

For this learning state, a classic experiment involves people wearing glasses that invert their vision and then performing tasks like grasping objects. Because the perceived location of objects is altered by the glasses, initial attempts always result in grasping errors. However, after entering a neuroplastic state, we can gradually adapt to the visual displacement, coordinating our hearing, actions, etc., to successfully complete the task. More interestingly, **this "neuroplasticity" chemical state can be sustained**. We can even trigger this brain mechanism through other operations first, then proceed with actual learning to accelerate the learning process. There's a hidden logic here: when you encounter setbacks and difficulties, your brain enters a plastic state, but if you give up at this point, **neurons will also rewire to this easily abandonable behavior pattern, forming a vicious cycle.**

The brain's natural neuroplasticity is better in childhood, but significantly declines after age 25. We will discuss how to overcome this later.

Additionally, **a lot of neural rewiring activity also occurs during rest and sleep**. This reinforces what we mentioned earlier: high-quality sleep is a prerequisite for achieving strong physiological and psychological health.

## Leveraging Neuroplasticity

If you are reading this article and are under 25, congratulations! Your neuroplasticity is still excellent, and you can **learn a wide range of knowledge and skills as much as possible**. For example, you can quickly learn various musical instruments, new languages, new sports, new professional skills, and so on. Through broader experiences, try to find the direction that interests you most, and then you can continue to delve deeper.

If you are already over 25 like me, there are still many ways to improve neuroplasticity:

- Experiments have shown that **adults can fully adapt to and master small, incremental learning**. For instance, if the visual deviation is only 7 degrees each time, rather than a sudden 180-degree flip, adults can quickly learn and correct from mistakes. Applied to actual learning, we can control the amount of content we learn each time to not be too much (this article might violate that, so it's suggested to save it and read slowly), accumulating multiple times to complete the nervous system's adjustment and learning.
- The stronger the desire to achieve a goal, the greater its importance, and the greater the reward stimulus (e.g., for survival), the more easily neuroplasticity will emerge. This is quite intuitive but may not be highly practical in real life.
- The third point is the most interesting: **disrupting the vestibular system can achieve a state of neuronal plasticity**. Simply put, it means providing your body with some "novel gravitational experiences," such as handstands, yoga, gymnastics, skateboarding, or any state that causes your body to lose balance. This rapidly triggers the "I made a mistake" signal, entering a learning state, and you can even proceed to learn other tasks afterward. This immediately made me think of **Taobao's "handstand culture" in its early days; I never expected it to have a scientific basis.** It's important to note that this experience must be novel. That is, if you are already skilled at handstands, then doing a handstand is a routine behavior and will not give your body a sensation of being on the verge of making a mistake, needing correction.

Huberman believes that the brain's main functional pathways are perception, cognition, emotion, thought, and action. When attempting to control our nervous system for various tasks (e.g., learning, solving difficult problems, pushing athletic limits), it's very difficult to control it directly through mental thought (e.g., constantly telling yourself not to get distracted). A more feasible approach is the "reverse pathway": starting from our actions, utilizing the nervous system's operational principles, and gradually influencing thought, emotion, cognition, and even perception. This is why Huberman highly advocates various "action tools." Mood follows action.

## Ideal State for Learning

Besides the chemical state of neuroplasticity, we also need to pay attention to other factors. For example, we **cannot be too relaxed to the point of drowsiness, nor too tense or excited to be unable to think clearly**. These are all related to the levels of chemical substances in our body such as dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, serotonin, and melatonin, and need to be well-regulated. In Rich Roll's previous interview, Huberman suggested a very effective "breathing tool" called the **Physiological Sigh**. In terms of operation, it's simply taking two inhales, then a long exhale. Typically, just one or two physiological sighs are enough to rapidly decrease our stress and alertness levels, making us feel calmer and improving learning performance.

The growth mindset mentioned earlier is also very important. When encountering feelings of frustration due to mistakes, you can continuously strengthen self-suggestion that failure is the only path to learning and growth, and that it's beneficial for us. This increases dopamine release, boosts learning motivation, and enhances pleasure during the process.

Connecting to the role of sleep in promoting learning, some studies also offer related tips:

- Listening to rhythmic beats while learning and playing the same faint beats while falling asleep can improve learning and memory.
- Generally, after 90 minutes of learning (the human biological clock cycle), choosing a 20-minute non-sleep deep rest can also enhance learning effectiveness.
- Gap effect: Randomly stopping for 10 seconds during learning. These stops will be "played back" faster during sleep, improving learning effectiveness.

## Improving Focus

"Focus" is underpinned by the coordination of two "network modes" in the brain: one called the Default Mode Network, which is activated when we're not actively doing anything, and another called Task Networks, which are activated when we're focused on specific tasks. In typical individuals, the brain coordinates these two modes well; they act like a seesaw, where one mode is activated while the other is inhibited. However, for individuals with attention disorders (like ADHD), these two cannot coordinate well, leading to difficulties in focusing.

By increasing dopamine levels, the coordination of these two network modes can be effectively promoted. Hence, many ADHD treatments involve increasing dopamine, such as **Adderall and Modafinil**. Some surveys indicate that the abuse of these drugs (often called smart drugs or nootropics) in the United States even surpasses that of marijuana, with many "academic overachievers" using them to boost attention and reduce sleep needs. However, Professor Huberman states that, on one hand, heightened dopamine stimulation inevitably leads to a dopamine level trough, and on the other hand, these drugs can also cause addiction and disrupt metabolism, with many negative effects, and **may not improve long-term learning and memory**. As mentioned in the dopamine section earlier, such drugs should be used cautiously and their frequency of use strictly controlled.

The best way to improve focus is, of course, better control of our dopamine system, as discussed earlier. This includes connecting actions to their underlying meaning, giving ourselves positive psychological cues, and breaking down tasks into smaller milestones to foster dopamine release and enhance focus through intrinsic motivation. Additionally, some safe and effective ways to improve focus include:

- Moderate supplementation of **Omega-3 EPA fish oil**, which is one of the building blocks of nerve cells, can effectively reduce depression and aid in treating ADHD.
- **Releasing energy through other body parts can help improve attention.** The professor gave an example of a neurosurgeon who, when operating, adopted a semi-squatting, semi-standing posture (releasing energy through movement), which made the hand holding the scalpel steadier and less prone to trembling. This reminds me that when I was a student, many classmates used to twirl pens, and now at work, many people like to play with fidget spinners or work standing up; these might have similar effects.
- **Limiting the field of vision can enhance focus.** For example, we often get distracted by flashing message notifications on the taskbar; we can use settings to enter a "focus mode."
- The height of your gaze also affects your neural state: **looking downwards tends to make the nervous system calm, relaxed, even sleepy, while looking upwards increases alertness.** When working, the monitor should generally be placed at least above nose level.
- The brain is not good at handling large numbers of frequent context switches. A typical example is endlessly scrolling on TikTok, where different information switches at a very fast pace. This is detrimental to our attention. A 2014 study indicated that **we should spend less than 60 minutes (teenagers) / 120 minutes (adults) on our phones daily** to avoid attention deficit issues.
- Research also shows that **17 minutes of meditation can rewire neurons in the brain, permanently improving attention**. Doing it just once can make a difference; it's definitely worth trying.

## Brain Health

Finally, let's look at some ways to improve brain health and efficiency.

First, as mentioned before, ensure high-quality sleep.

In terms of exercise, **aerobic exercise is most directly beneficial for the brain**, improving cardiovascular function and supporting brain energy supply. It's recommended to do 150-180 minutes of aerobic training per week.

For foods that help brain health, the first three points are more important; subsequent points involve less research:

- **Omega-3, especially EPA fatty acids**, are a crucial component of the brain and are generally under-consumed by most people. Eat more fish, oysters, caviar, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans. Consume at least 1.5 grams per day, ideally over 3 grams. If you don't like fish, you can supplement with fish oil.
- **Phosphatidylserine** also aids cognitive ability. Consume through fish, meat, and cabbage.
- **Choline**, an important neuromodulator, enhances attention. Important sources of choline are eggs, especially egg yolks. Potatoes, nuts, and fruits also contain it, though not as abundantly as egg yolks. It can be obtained through supplements like Alpha-GPC.
- Creatine, especially for non-meat eaters, requires about 5 grams per day.
- Anthocyanins, found in blueberries, blackberries, grapes, and other foods. They can reduce DNA damage and alleviate cognitive decline. Approximately 60-120 grams of blueberries are needed daily.
- Glutamine can be consumed through beef, chicken, fish, eggs, soybeans, cabbage, spinach, and celery. It improves brain performance under hypoxia (high altitude regions) and can also suppress sugar cravings.
- Water, sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other electrolytes are essential elements for neuronal signal transmission and need to be ensured.

This section also discussed the three channels through which our body judges preferences for various foods. The first two are taste judgment and subconscious judgment of nutritional content. The third is quite interesting and also related to dopamine: we can **increase our liking for certain foods by boosting the brain's metabolic activity**. For example, if you don't like fish, one method is to eat fish with foods you normally love. Another is to give yourself sufficient psychological suggestion, convincing yourself that eating fish is beneficial for your health. Through both methods, you can make your brain release dopamine, gradually increasing your preference for fish.

# Longevity

Finally, let's look at how to extend lifespan. This is an episode of Huberman's interview with a leading expert in the field, David Sinclair from Harvard.

⚠️ Update: As of 2025-06-17, scientific evidence regarding Professor David Sinclair and his advocated anti-aging products like resveratrol and NMN still remains highly controversial. Please refer to and adopt related content with caution.

## The Nature of Aging

Sinclair believes that aging is a disease, and it itself leads to the emergence of many commonly understood diseases, such as Alzheimer's, cancer, etc. We can "treat" aging through scientific means, and even reverse it.

In essence, aging is **the loss of genetic information**, which consists of two parts:

- The DNA information itself, e.g., DNA structures in cells can be damaged by radiation.
- The information controlling which genes are expressed is damaged, i.e., the epigenome. This part accounts for 80% of aging factors.

The human body has a natural "aging clock," and it doesn't tick at a constant speed. During our growth and development in youth, this clock ticks faster. So generally, people who develop rapidly during puberty tend to have a faster overall clock and a relatively shorter lifespan, which might sound a bit scary... Moreover, generally smaller people, like dwarfs, rarely get heart disease or cancer, and tend to live significantly longer. But don't worry, as mentioned earlier, the genetic information itself only accounts for 20% of aging factors; **the control of gene expression accounts for the majority.**

It was somewhat surprising that the most important experiments Professor Sinclair introduced were all related to fasting, which we discussed earlier. For example, the typical lifespan of a mouse is about 2 years, but his lab had a mouse named Yoda that lived a full 5 years. Its main approach involved selecting dwarf genes and implementing fasting.

The professor explained in detail **why fasting can increase animal/human lifespan by over 30%**:

- At low blood sugar levels, the body inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activates sirtuins, creating a very favorable chemical state that clears old proteins, improves insulin sensitivity, provides more energy, repairs cells, and more. This latter enzyme, sirtuin, is an important weapon against aging.
- When insulin levels are low, "longevity genes" like SIRT1 are activated.
- Fasting gives cells sufficient "rest time."
- Low blood sugar levels make the body more sensitive to insulin, absorbing blood sugar faster, which is also beneficial for health.
- When you never experience hunger, your aging clock also ticks faster.
- Besides the autophagy triggered by 24-hour cycle fasting, there are deeper clearing mechanisms that start on the second or third day of fasting. Experiments on older mice showed that such prolonged fasting could extend their lifespan by 35%. However, this is quite difficult for average people to implement.

Sinclair also contrasted some failed studies from the last century, such as those attempting to combat aging with antioxidants. The core idea of modern longevity research is how to **trigger the body's own aging resistance mechanisms through certain means.**

Furthermore, Sinclair introduced some exciting cutting-edge technologies, such as **gene therapy methods that can restart our DNA expression system**. A single injection can restore sight to blind individuals, which has already been verified in mice. Perhaps in a few years, we might be able to reverse aging in various body parts, like Deadpool.

## Anti-Aging Strategies

Let's first take an overview of various anti-aging strategies.

### Diet

This includes food structure and dietary control. Regarding dietary control, as mentioned earlier, it's recommended to shorten the eating window to around 8 hours. For diet structure, you can refer to the latest article published in Cell: [Nutrition, longevity and disease: From molecular mechanisms to interventions](<https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(22)00398-1.pdf>). In summary, eat more plant-based proteins (peanuts, quinoa, beans, broccoli, etc.) and fats (olive oil, nuts, avocado, etc.), and reduce refined carbohydrates (white rice, white bread, cakes, cookies, etc.); animal fats, animal proteins, and sugar generally accelerate aging.

### Physical Exercise

Aerobic exercise greatly helps extend life by promoting cardiovascular function and blood vessel health. Strength training also continuously maintains the strength of our muscles, joints, and ligaments, and their protective capabilities, reducing the risk of falls or injuries as we age. It is generally recommended to do about 3 hours of aerobic exercise per week, paired with 2 to 3 strength training sessions. Aerobic exercise is usually simple, like running, cycling, or swimming. Strength training has a certain threshold; I am also currently learning some beginner training methods.

### Pharmaceuticals

There is also a lot of research on pharmaceuticals, though most are still in early human trials. For details, you can refer to this article published in Nature: [The quest to slow ageing through drug discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-020-0067-7), which summarizes various related studies, including the famous metformin, NMN, and others.

![Drugs for Longevity](imgs/drugs_for_longevity.png)

### Cell Reprogramming

As mentioned earlier, gene expression is the most important factor affecting aging. So, are there ways to control gene expression in human cells? The famous Yamanaka Factors provide a possibility. The induction method discovered by Shinya Yamanaka's team involves introducing four transcription factor genes—Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4—into adult cells via lentiviral vectors, converting them into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) similar to embryonic stem cells. iPS cells possess regenerative capabilities similar to embryonic stem cells, and theoretically can differentiate into all organs and tissues of an adult, perfectly counteracting human aging caused by cellular decline. Doesn't that sound incredibly magical? Based on these new technologies, many tech innovation companies focused on longevity have emerged, such as [Life Biosciences](https://www.lifebiosciences.com/) and [Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/). We can look forward to the widespread application of these technologies in the future.

## Practice

Here are some of Sinclair's personal practices; if you decide to adopt them, you should consider your own situation. Interestingly, a popular comment under this episode was that the professor is already 52 years old but looks nothing like it... so you understand.

- Skips breakfast, eats very little for lunch (yogurt or olive oil), and primarily eats vegetables for dinner, with fish and shrimp. Rarely eats steak. Does not eat sugar, desserts, or bread. Essentially achieves an advanced fasting state with a 2-hour eating window. He occasionally tries not eating at all for an entire day, but finds it difficult to maintain.
- Takes 1 gram of resveratrol, 1 gram of NMN (which converts to NAD, the "fuel" for sirtuin) daily, and metformin. He might skip some supplements on exercise days. He does not take multivitamins.
- Benefits of a plant-based diet: rich in various nutrients and vitamins; contains xenohormesis, substances produced by plants under "stress," beneficial for longevity. The latter can also be supplemented with quercetin.
- Usually alternates between aerobic exercise and strength training every other day. Aerobic exercise can increase NAD levels.
- Determines some medication intake based on family medical history; for example, he started taking cholesterol-lowering medication at age 29.
- Regarding artificial sweeteners, the professor believes they are generally safe. He occasionally drinks Diet Coke.

For this series of practices, Professor Sinclair has conducted over 10 years of self-experimentation, monitoring various body data. By monitoring data, one can infer a person's "biological age" (not just by looking at their face). Under his practices, his own biological age has continuously decreased, now reaching around 30 years old (actual age 52). Additionally, he believes that everyone's physical condition is different, and the conventionally accepted physiological indicator ranges in hospitals may not be suitable for everyone. **In the future, real-time monitoring of health data and personalized diagnostics will become mainstream.** He gave some examples:

- Monitoring blood sugar level HbA1c to observe the effects of fasting, etc.
- Monitoring inflammation marker CRP, which is related to the induction of heart disease and various other diseases.
- Monitoring LDL, and controlling it through medication etc. Dietary cholesterol has almost no effect on blood cholesterol, so there's no need to cut out red meat, butter, etc.
- Iron supplementation might accelerate aging. Medical indicators need to be personalized; low iron levels don't necessarily lead to anemia.

Some other negative factors affecting lifespan:

- Obesity accelerates aging.
- Smoking damages gene expression and accelerates aging.
- X-ray examinations are similar; avoid exposure when unnecessary.

Looking ahead at longevity research, it's quite exciting. Modern science extends our average lifespan by 1/4 year every year. If it could extend our average lifespan by more than 1 year every year, we would reach **"longevity escape velocity"** (analogous to flying west at 1000 miles per hour, where the sun never sets), achieving "immortality." Famous futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts this could be achieved in about 12 years (2034). Let's wait and see.

In addition to this podcast episode, I must also include Geekan's highly-starred project: [Programmer's Guide to Longevity](https://github.com/geekan/HowToLiveLonger).

# Personal Practice

The content introduced above is quite extensive, and this article has become rather long. Finally, I'll briefly introduce some of the actions and auxiliary tools I currently use.

In terms of sleep, I currently don't have any special measures; with a child, my sleep quality at night is generally not great. I just try to avoid looking at my phone after 11 PM. As for getting light exposure in the morning, I generally get it during my morning dog walk or commute, so there's not much pressure. For those who are more particular, you can download the [My Circadian Clock App](https://mycircadianclock.org/) to track your biological clock; it's a project co-developed by experts like Satchin Panda, so it's trustworthy.

Regarding diet, I've started trying 8-hour eating window fasting and currently feel good. Lunch is usually a light meal, primarily vegetables, while dinner is more flexible—I eat whatever I want. In the morning, I sometimes drink salt water, tea, or an AG1 supplement, depending on the situation. For dietary supplements, I currently only use multivitamins and EPA fish oil. I might consider adding more later, referring to [Huberman's "formula"](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/). Huberman himself stated in his program that he's **still observing resveratrol and NMN**, and I've found quite a bit of controversy surrounding them, so I personally recommend adopting widely recognized and used supplements first, such as EPA fish oil and metformin. My current list of supplements under consideration:

- [Basic Nutrients](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/basic-nutrients-2-day), a regular supplement. You can also choose specific nutrient supplements based on your diet and lifestyle.
- [Omega-3 EPA](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/super-epa-sp608nc), a consistently top-selling supplement, with benefits extensively discussed earlier.
- [AG1](https://athleticgreens.com/en), the super popular "green powder" with various plant extracts + vitamins and minerals, mentioned in programs by Fridman and other experts. I bought it once, but some other reviews suggest it might not be very cost-effective.
- [Betaine HCL & Pepsin](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/betaine-hcl-pepsin-225-s), for gut protection and enhanced absorption.
- [L-Tyrosine](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/l-tyrosine), to boost dopamine; might buy some to try.
- [Metformin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin), an "anti-aging miracle drug," however, its effectiveness and safety are still debated, so use with caution.
- [ResveraCel](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/resveracel), ⚠️ a combination for anti-aging with resveratrol, NR, etc. Its effects are also controversial, especially the NMN part, with various products being mixed and indistinguishable, so purchase with caution.

Many people are concerned that fasting might cause gallstones. Here is some supplementary information:

- From [Bloch, H. M. et al.'s paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1419405/), it appears that bile saturation during fasting undergoes a process of first increasing then decreasing. [Dr. Berg also used this to explain](https://youtu.be/2lGuXBwudKw) that fasting combined with a ketogenic diet (fat intake) is actually beneficial for gallbladder health.
- From the results of [Sichieri, R. et al.'s paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.uk/pmc/articles/PMC1405175/), long overnight fasting and dieting may increase the probability of gallstones. However, weight loss (fat reduction) itself increases the probability of gallstones.
- Studies related to continuous fasting for more than 24 hours are relatively few (difficult to implement), but mechanistically, prolonged fasting should increase the probability of gallstones.
- Dietary structure and individual health conditions also significantly influence gallstone formation, e.g., high cholesterol, high insulin levels, high carbohydrate diets. High-fiber foods and healthy fat intake help reduce the probability of gallstones.

Overall, I personally feel that there is no definitive conclusion in this area of research (just like [whether coffee causes gallstones](https://www.coffeeandhealth.org/factsheet/gallstones-factsheet)), but it should not be a high-probability issue. At least Professor Huberman and another authority in the field, Professor Satchin Panda, have not mentioned this issue. The ideal situation is to continuously track your medical indicators when performing fasting. The rest is up to personal choice :)

For work, study, and focus, it mainly comes down to self-discipline. I generally manage this well. After understanding how dopamine works, I feel even more confident. I mainly use the focus modes of various software to approximate the Pomodoro Technique, and I've also adopted a standing desk, spending about 30% of my time working standing up. During work breaks, I try Yoga Nidra. Additionally, during evening study periods, I use the Books app on my iPad to track reading time, basically maintaining over 30 minutes daily, consistently. I'm considering trying Yerba Mate during work and starting cold showers in the summer.

Exercise has been the biggest improvement for me this past year. With the encouragement of my Xiaomi band's PAI index feature, I've consistently achieved an average of 3 running or badminton sessions per week, keeping my PAI score around 200. Overall, it has significantly improved my mental state, and I've reduced a lot of belly fat. My only minor issue is that I usually start exercising after work, around 9 or 10 PM, which is relatively close to bedtime and sometimes affects sleep quality.

Finally, Professor Huberman's podcast contains much other content, such as habit formation, fitness and muscle gain, dealing with fear and trauma, emotion management, etc. Interested friends can explore further. This article primarily presents experimental facts and theoretical hypotheses. All action plans mentioned above should be executed after consulting a physician or professional, and considering your own circumstances, ensuring your safety. Neither I nor Huberman are liable for any related consequences.
